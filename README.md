# Caesar-Sipher

# 🔐 Caesar Cipher - Python Project

A simple Python implementation of the **Caesar Cipher** – one of the oldest known encryption techniques. This project allows you to **encrypt and decrypt** messages using a basic shift algorithm.

## 📌 What is Caesar Cipher?

The **Caesar Cipher** is a substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.
For example:
- With a shift of 3, `A` becomes `D`, `B` becomes `E`, and so on.

## 🚀 Features
- Encrypt plain text with a custom shift value  
- Decrypt cipher text  
- Works with both uppercase and lowercase letters  
- Ignores non-alphabet characters (e.g., numbers, punctuation)  

## 📦 Example

```text
Enter your message: Hello World!
Enter shift number: 3
Encrypted message: Khoor Zruog!
```

## 📖 Concepts Used

- Loops  
- Functions  
- String manipulation  
- ASCII character handling
